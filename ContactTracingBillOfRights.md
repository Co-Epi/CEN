Contact Tracing Bill of Rights

1. Users must be able to install and use a contact tracing app without having to divulge any personal information to anyone.
2. Contact tracing apps must not disclose any information during normal operation that can be used by third parties to track a user’s interactions or locations.
3. All information disclosed by users through a contact-tracing app must be completely opt-in, with clear informed consent both as to the nature of what they’re disclosing and the likely impacts of doing so.
4. When users choose to altruistically share information, that information must remain completely anonymous: no information may be required other than that which is essential for alerting others to potential exposure.
5. If apps collect any information, such as location histories, that is not essential for alerting others who may be exposed, users must not be expected or coerced to share that information by default. If a contact tracing app allows for the sharing of any location history, symptom reports, demographic information, or similar with public health officials or similar, such sharing must be completely anonymous, voluntary, and opt-in, and based on clear and easy to understand informed consent.

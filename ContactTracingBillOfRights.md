# Contact Tracing Bill of Rights

## Digital Contact Tracing and Alerting Data Use Definition

Digital contact tracing apps can be effective without a user having to divulge any personal information to anyone. Data processed within digital contact tracing applications and infrastructure may only reveal the following types of information to the following types of individuals:

* Plausibly exposed individuals that they may have been exposed
* Health officials, of general, high level trends in exposure (not individual level)
* Verifying to authorities that an individual is healthy or sick, with the explicit consent of the individual at each verification.

Contact tracing data or derived data may not be disclosed to third parties, such as analytics and ad targeting services. 

Aggregate data should be processed with privacy-protecting techniques such as differential privacy. The methodologies and techniques should be available for public review. 

Private-sector contact tracing apps should be open source and/or available for audit from an independent third party.

When developing a contact tracing app, developers should identify one or more well-defined problems that will be mitigated, solved, or improved.

## Individual Data Rights for Digital Contact Tracing


1. Data collection should be limited to achieve a defined purpose. 
2. All information disclosed by users through a contact-tracing app should be completely opt-in, with clear informed consent both as to the nature of what they’re disclosing how it is used, the likely impacts of disclosure and use, and any choices the user may have. Any new use requires fresh consent. Users can withdraw their consent at any given time.
3. When users choose to altruistically share their health information, that information should remain completely anonymous: no information should be required other than that which is essential, based on epidemiological standards, for alerting others to potential exposure. 
4. Information such as location history, symptom reports, demographic information, or similar shared with public health officials or researchers must never be linked back to or used to re-identify individuals, and must not be shared with entities legally allowed to perform such linkage unless required by law, such as with a subpoena.
5. Data may be aggregated so that it may not allow for the identification of individuals. Aggregate data may be maintained for public research purposes. Precautions should be taken to ensure that shared aggregate data may not be re-identified downstream.  
6. Application developers should have a very clear and reasonable data retention policy based on epidemiological standards, and must not retain any data for longer than required to achieve the app’s objective.
7. Data should be secured on the users device according to industry standards.
8. An individual has ownership over the data collected and stored on their mobile device. 
9. Data collected by or derived from contact tracing apps should not be monetized, shared, or used for any other non-public-health purpose. 
10. Contact tracing apps shall be developed in collaboration with the privacy and security community, government agencies, technology community, and public health professionals, including epidemiologists.
11. All contact tracing apps must be in compliance with local data protection laws and regulations.
12. Contact tracing apps should use an openly published protocol to ensure that their solution is verifiable and interoperable. For example, [the TCN Protocol](https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN), and [Apple/Google COVID-19 contact tracing technology](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/).
